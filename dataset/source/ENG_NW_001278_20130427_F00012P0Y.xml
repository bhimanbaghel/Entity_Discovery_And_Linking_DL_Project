Central Bank of Cyprus appoints Bank of Cyprus provisional board

NICOSIA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Cyprus on Friday appointed a provisional board at the Bank of Cyprus (BOC), an important first step toward the bank's restructuring following an unprecedented haircut imposed on its major depositors and the forced takeover of a wound-down lender by BOC.

The 14-member board will meet to elect a president and a CEO and will schedule a meeting of new shareholders to elect a permanent board.

This is not expected to be done before September next as details of the merger of the Bank of Cyprus with Cyprus Popular Bank, also known as Laiki Bank, will be completed in a mazy procedure set to be concluded at the end of June. Laiki is the island's second largest lender.

The Eurogroup imposed an unprecedented haircut on major deposits at the Bank of Cyprus which may go up to 60 percent as part of a bailout deal for the eastern Mediterranean island worth 10 billion euros (13 billion U.S. dollars). It also folded Laiki Bank into the Bank of Cyprus.

The so-called bail-in used in Cyprus has been projected by some Eurogroup leaders as a possible prototype to save crumbling banks in other EU members.

Money taken off savings of over 100,000 euros, of which many were held by Russians, at the Bank of Cyprus will be turned into bank stock and the depositors.

Bank of Cyprus had been run by an administrator appointed by the Central Bank, under the supervision and direction of the European Central Bank since the bail-in came into effect.

The removal of the administrator and appointment of a provisional bank board was a major demand by the Cypriot government and the business community, which has been badly hit by lack of liquidity and strict bank transactions.

The move to appoint a provisional board came just 24 hours after a surprise meeting between President Nicos Anastasiades and Central Bank governor Panicos Demetriades, who have been at loggerheads over the handling of the banking system ever since the levy on bank deposits came into force at a March 25 EurogPRAroup meeting.

Also on Friday, new regulations on bank operations came into force, relaxing strict bank transactions and enabling foreign individuals and businesses to have access to their bank accounts in foreign banks operating in Cyprus for the first time since bank restrictions came into force about five weeks ago.

Relaxing restrictions on foreign banks, and especially on a subsidiary of the Russian VTB Bank had been made a condition by Moscow for restructuring a 2.5 billion euros loan to Cyprus, maturing in 2016.

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov had said during a meeting of the G20 in Washington that Russia would deliver its support to Cyprus taking into account its interests, which were linked to the operation in normal conditions of the VTB subsidiary in Cyprus, Russian Commercial Bank.

VTB's management had asked the Russian government earlier in April to help in removing the restrictions on its operations in Cyprus.  Enditem
