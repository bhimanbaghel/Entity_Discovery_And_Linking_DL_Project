OSCE calls for dialogue to settle Ukrainian protests

KIEV, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) called on Thursday for peaceful solutions through dialogue to massive protests here in recent two weeks.

"In this process, there is no alternative to dialogue between political groups, the people and the government through the democratically elected institutions," said OSCE Parliamentary Assembly President Ranko Krivokapic.

The OSCE's ministerial council began its meeting here Thursday, which had been scheduled long before the protests in the Ukrainian capital.

Noting that the process of building democracy is often painful, Krivokapic voiced his belief that Ukraine will overcome the current difficulties to provide a stronger and more stable government for the people.

The rally in Kiev against the government's decision to suspend a trade pact with the European Union (EU) has lasted for 14 days.

The protests escalated last weekend after the violent clashes between police and protesters left over 50 protesters injured.

Shortly after the clashes, the protesters occupied Ukraine's administrative buildings, raising demands including the impeachment of President Viktor Yanukovych, resignation of the government and disbandment of parliament.

Ukraine, due to sign partnership agreements with the EU at the Eastern Partnership Summit in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius on Nov. 28-29, put the deal on hold on Nov. 21 for closer trade ties with Russia instead. The announcement has ever since triggered waves of protests in major Ukrainian cities.  Enditem
