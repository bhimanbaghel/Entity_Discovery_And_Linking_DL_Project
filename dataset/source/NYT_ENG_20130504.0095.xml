DEATH TOLL IN BANGLADESH BUILDING COLLAPSE TOPS 500
</HEADLINE>

<P>
SAVAR, Bangladesh – The death toll in the Rana Plaza disaster soared to 517 on Friday, as work crews spent a 10th day digging through the rubble and investigators continued to interrogate the building’s owner and others arrested in the case.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Rana Plaza building, which housed five clothing factories, is the worst disaster in the garment industry’s history, with the death toll likely to rise as work crews now use heavy machinery to clear debris from some of the most devastated sections of the building.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of onlookers, some bearing photographs of loved ones still unaccounted for, visit the wreckage daily. On Friday, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Bangladesh’s home minister, said more arrests were possible.
</P>
<P>
“This is a case of sheer negligence and sheer arrogance,” Alamgir said in an interview. “Arrogance on the part of the owner and negligence by the engineers and the local government authorities.”
</P>
<P>
The police have already arrested the building’s owner, Sohel Rana, the owners of four of the factories and three engineers.
</P>
<P>
Savar’s mayor has been suspended for granting permits for the building’s construction.
</P>
<P>
The arrest Thursday of one of the engineers, Abdur Razzaque Khan, was a surprise, because Khan had been praised for trying to persuade the owner to close the building a day before it collapsed, warning that it was unsafe.
</P>
<P>
The police initially said they arrested Khan because they wanted to interrogate him about accusations by Rana and the factory owners, who had blamed the engineer for reassuring them that the building was not at risk.
</P>
<P>
But Friday, Alamgir said the engineer was accused of helping to plan and approve three upper floors of the building that had been added illegally in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Even as work crews continue to look for bodies, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, the country’s finance minister, made ill-timed remarks during a visit to New Delhi, predicting that the disaster would not slow the country’s garment industry.
</P>
<P>
“The present difficulties, well, I don’t think it is really serious. It’s an accident,” he said, according to The Associated Press. “And the steps that we have taken in order to make sure that it doesn’t happen, they are quite elaborate, and I believe that it will be appreciated by all.”
