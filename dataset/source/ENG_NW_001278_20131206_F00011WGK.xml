(Recast) Australian politicians lament over Nelson Mandela's death

CANBERRA, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott lamented over former South African President Nelson Mandela 's death in a statement on Friday.

Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest freedom fighters and political leaders of the 20th century, has died aged 95 surrounded by family at his Johannesburg home.

Elected as South Africa's first black president in 1994, Mandela was widely revered around the world for his efforts to unify South Africa after the end of apartheid.

"On behalf of the Australian government and the Australian community, I extend my condolences to Mr. Mandela's family and to the people of South Africa," Abbott said.

According to this statement, Abbott said that Nelson Mandela will forever be remembered as more than a political leader. "He was a moral leader," Abbott confirmed.

"He spent much of his life standing against the injustice of apartheid. When that fight was won, he inspired us again by his capacity to forgive and reconcile his country," he said.

"While the world may never see another Nelson Mandela, he has inspired countless men and women throughout the world to live more courageous and honest lives," Abbott added.

Australian Governor-General Quentin Bryce also said Friday that "no person in our lifetime had been more admired and respected" than Nelson Mandela.

Nelson Mandela's death brings great sadness to the world. "Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr Mandela's family and the people of South Africa at this time of sorrow and mourning," Bryce said in a statement.

"He inspired us all by his leadership and enduring commitment to the recognition of the worth of every human being. The freedom and reconciliation that followed years of injustice and struggle would continue to capture the imagination of people everywhere."

Other Australian politicians expressed their lament over Nelson Mandela's passing away, such as former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Australian Greens leader Christine Milne and former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.

Julia Gillard has lamented the death of Nelson Mandela by twitter, saying the world has lost a great man.

"As we grieve for Nelson Mandela we should also celebrate his tremendous victory over prejudice and hate," she said in her twitter on Friday.

Christine Milne also paid tribute to the former South African leader. "He was one of the most inspiring, courageous and humble leaders of the 20th century," she said in a tweet Friday.

And Kevin Rudd described Nelson Mandela as the "man of the century." "A light just went out across the world," he tweeted on Friday.  Enditem
