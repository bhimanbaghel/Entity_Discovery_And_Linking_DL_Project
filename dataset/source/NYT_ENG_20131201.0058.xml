HONG KONG - China’s latest display of ambition in space involves sending a Jade Rabbit roaming across the Bay of Rainbows.

A rocket blasted off from southwest China early Monday, carrying the country’s first robotic lunar rover, the Jade Rabbit, which will explore a plain on the moon that, despite its colorful name, is a dark expanse of hardened lava.

If successful, the Chang’e-3 mission will be China’s first “soft landing” on the moon - which allows a craft to operate after descending - and the first such landing by any country since 1976, when the Soviet Union sent a probe. The last U.S. expedition on the moon’s surface was a manned visit in 1972. Chinese state-run television broadcast footage of the rocket’s untroubled launch and ascent into space, where the Chang’e-3 craft set off toward the moon.

For China’s Communist Party under President Xi Jinping, such feats embody his rallying cry of a “Chinese dream” of patriotic unity under one-party rule, supported by technological advances and rising international stature.

“If it’s all successful, it will certainly indicate that they have really come up the learning curve in terms of technology,” said Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island who researches China’s space activities. Johnson-Freese emphasized that she was giving her own views.

“China’s getting a lot of prestige, which turns into geostrategic influence,” she said.

The Chinese state-run news media has responded to the launch from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center with an outpouring of jubilation. That is likely to reach a crescendo in about two weeks, when the landing vehicle is scheduled to descend on the moon and release the Jade Rabbit, or Yutu, robotic rover to start sending back data and pictures from Sinus Iridum, or the Bay of Rainbows, a basaltic plain formed from lava that filled a crater.

But as well as patriotic pride, China’s space activities are generating skills to enhance the country’s science, satellites and military, experts said. China’s advances in space include five manned flights, which are intended to pave the way for a space station.

For the Chang’e-3 mission, the rover - a solar-powered, six-wheeled vehicle similar to ones the United States has sent to Mars - will spend three months exploring, using radar to collect data on rocks up to 328 feet below the surface,
