SYRIAN ARMY AND HEZBOLLAH STEP UP ATTACKS ON A REBEL STRONGHOLD

BEIRUT - The Syrian government and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah intensified their assault on Syrian rebels in the town of Qusair on Saturday, unleashing the heaviest shelling since the battle began a week ago, Syrian anti-government activists said.
</P>
<P>
The battle raged as neighboring Lebanon commemorated the 13th anniversary of the end of Israel’s 15-year occupation of its southern region, which is widely credited to Hezbollah’s years of guerrilla warfare.

<P>
Syrian opposition activists said that government forces and Hezbollah had ratcheted up the attacks in an effort to allow Hezbollah to claim victory, or at least success on the battlefield, at a holiday rally where the group’s revered leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was scheduled to address his followers via videotape.

<P>
“Hezbollah wants to score points and successes to justify the death of its soldiers in Syria before the speech today,” said Rami Abdulrahman of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition group that tracks the violence through a network of contacts inside Syria. Hezbollah’s fighters have suffered unexpected losses in Qusair, reportedly numbering in the dozens, as the tenacity of the rebels has surprised Syrian government supporters and opponents.

<P>
In Lebanon, the holiday has been marred by tension over Hezbollah’s deepening assistance of President Bashar Assad in Syria, where the group’s Lebanese Sunni rivals support the rebels. The death toll rose to 29 in the worst sectarian clashes in years in Lebanon’s northern city of Tripoli, widely seen as spurred by the Qusair fighting
</P>
<P>
In Qusair, rocket and artillery attacks killed 22 people, wounded dozens and destroyed houses and buildings where some civilians are living, Abdulrahman said.
</P>
<P>
An opposition media activist, Hadi Abdullah, who often films himself at the front lines, described the fighting on Twitter. “Al Qusayr is getting destroyed and completely burned. Hundreds of shells and rockets in all types are falling nonstop on us,” he wrote. “Houses are burning and destroyed.” Other anti-government activists posted a video on YouTube showing nonstop shelling and bombing, while clouds of smoke rose up in what seemed like a lifeless city.
</P>
<P>
During the last week, the Syrian military, pro-government militias and Hezbollah appeared to have seized parts of Qusair as rebels held on in the north - though the two sides each claimed to be prevailing and there was little independent confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Syria’s state news agency, SANA, said Saturday the army had entered the northern part of the city, “killed numbers of terrorists and destroyed their dens and equipment.”
