Indonesian FM urges end of violence in Egypt

JAKARTA, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Marty Natalegawa urged on Thursday an immediate end of violence usage in dispersing demonstrators in Egypt, saying that Indonesia is deeply concerned on the development of conditions there that continues worsening.

"The use of force, which has led to the loss of lives, will not address the issue. The international community needs to support efforts of reconciliation among the parties in Egypt and urge the ending of violence," Marty said in his official statement in response to the latest violence conducted by authorities against supporters of the deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi.

Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population and is an active member of Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC).

The latest violence against thousands of Morsi supporters took place on Wednesday when Egyptian military and police forcefully disperse the demonstrators staging protests in Cairo's landmark Rabiah Adawiyah square with tanks, helicopters and bulldozers. Reports said that shootings were heard during the operation.

The latest violence made the vice president of Egyptian transition government Mohamed El Baradei resign in protest against violence used by the apparatus to disperse protesters.

The Egyptian government imposed martial law on 14 provinces across the country on Wednesday following the protest dispersion.

A total of 278 people were killed during political commotion in the Middle East country following the downfall of Mohamed Morsi early last Month, reports said.

Morsi, the president-elect from the Muslim Brotherhood party who was elected through a democratic election last year, was ousted by the military. A transition government led by President Adly Mansour was established to replace the Morsi administration. EnditemB
