Cyprus president-elect appoints finance, foreign ministers

NICOSIA, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus president-elect Nicos Anastasiades on Monday turned to two seasoned personalities to serve in the crucial posts of his cabinet.

Economist Michael Sarris was appointed as finance minister to handle complex negotiations for a bailout by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, as cash strapped Cyprus is just weeks away from a potential bankruptcy.

Sarris, 67, has served as finance minister when Cyprus joined the eurozone in 2008. He has also served as a senior economist for the World Bank.

Two years ago he refused appointment by the outgoing government, saying he did not feel he had a clear mandate to handle the economic crisis which had already become manifest.

Anastasiades also appointed Ioannis Kasoulides as foreign minister.

Kasoulides, aged 65, has also served as foreign minister for six years during which Cyprus negotiated its accession to the European Union.

A member of the European Parliament since 2004, Kasoulides knows the ins and outs in the European Union. He is a France educated man, with a specialty in geriatrics.

Anastasiades, who leads the right-wing Democratic Rally party, scored an easy win in a presidential election runoff on Sunday with a 57.48 percent share of the vote, facing Stavros Malas who had been backed by leftist ruling AKEL party.

Announcing the appointments of his two first ministers, Anastasiades repeated his top priority of quickly finalizing a provisional bailout deal negotiated by the outgoing government with international lenders.

A Eurogroup ministerial meeting in Brussels on Monday was set to consider the Cyprus bailout, with members reported to be divided on how to handle a bank recapitalization.

Germany and some other countries are reportedly pushing for bank depositors to take a loss while many other member states expressed concerns that such a move could bring more harm to the banks by causing depositors to massively withdraw their money.

Anastasiades said that in this context it was deciPRAded to expedite the appointment of the two ministers, even though other ministers are still under consideration.

"We want to send a message to our European partners of our commitment to effectively deal with the problems facing our country," Anastasiades said.

He added that the full lineup of his government would be in place when he officially takes office on Friday.

He is to take an oath of allegiance to the constitution before parliament on Thursday afternoon and soon afterwards the outgoing president will hand over the presidency.

Anastasiades also announced the formation of a National Economy Council under Nobel laureate Professor Christoforos Pissarides to hammer out a strategy out of the crisis.  Enditem
