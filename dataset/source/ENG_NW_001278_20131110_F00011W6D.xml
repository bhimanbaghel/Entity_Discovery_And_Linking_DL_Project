Roundup: 4.4 mln people affected in typhoon-hit C. Philippine region

MANILA, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government disaster relief agency said Sunday about 4.4 million people have become homeless in areas hit by super typhoon Haiyan (local name Yolanda).

Among these people, 86,513 families or 403,503 persons were housed in 1,425 evacuation centers, said  National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).

Haiyan, the most powerful typhoon in the Philippines in its history, engulfed many areas in Leyte, Eastern Samar, Western and Central Visayas, Bicol and Northern Mindanao regions.

"The sea water rose as high as 20 feet, causing the people to drown," said Leo Dacaynos of the Eastern Samar provincial disaster risk reduction council.

As of Sunday, many parts of Eastern Visayas are still without electricity. Downed communication facilities caused problems in gathering information from Tacloban City and other affected areas in Leyte, official said, adding officials are relying on satellite phones and military radios.

The number of deaths from the wrath of super typhoon Haiyan continue to pile up as authorities continue to exert efforts to retrieve bodies in Tacloban City and other worse-hit areas. Local media reported 10,000 people were feared dead.

NDRRMC operations officer and spokesman Rey Balido said Tacloban City airport remains closed to commercial flights after the facility sustained damages.

"The only aircraft landing there, particularly in Tacloban, are military efforts. We are bringing relief goods (to Leyte) through other means like vessels of the Philippine Navy and Philippine Coast Guard," he said.

Interior and Local Government Secretary Manuel Roxas said authorities are clearing the roads in Tacloban City for the smooth retrieval of bodies.

He said homes made of light materials along the coast were destroyed "by the giant surge from the seashore which came with high winds."

Philippine President Benigno Aquino III flew to Tacloban City in Leyte provinc)ne Sunday morning and was set to visit Roxas City in Capiz province later in the day to inspect those places hardly hit by Haiyan and to distribute relief goods to the affected residents.

The military has sent 100 soldiers to join police efforts in restoring peace and order in Tacloban City, as local residents looted the Gaisano mall and stole cash from automated teller machines in the city, said Armed Forces of the Philippines Public Affairs Office chief Ramon Zagala.

The United Kingdom on Sunday announced the provision of at least 414 million pesos (9.58 million U.S. dollars) to help the Philippine relief rescue for the victims in disaster-hit areas.  Enditem
