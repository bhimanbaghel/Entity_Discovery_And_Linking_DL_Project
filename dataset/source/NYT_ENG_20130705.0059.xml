CAIRO - Islamist supporters of Mohammed Morsi, Egypt’s ousted president, held enormous and defiant protests across Cairo and elsewhere Friday demanding his reinstatement and engaging in sometimes deadly clashes with security forces and anti-Morsi demonstrators that threatened to further deepen the country’s polarization.

Witnesses said at least five pro-Morsi demonstrators were killed and many more wounded in gunfire outside the Republican Guard compound where Morsi was believed to be detained, as thousands confronted a phalanx of armed soldiers, armored vehicles and barbed wire ringing the facility. “Where’s Morsi?” they screamed.

Rival crowds of protesters hurled rocks, missiles, Molotov cocktails and fireworks at each other elsewhere in the capital, including Tahrir Square, the spiritual center of Egypt’s 2011 revolution, and the 6th October Bridge, a heavily traveled elevated highway in central Cairo. Ahram Online, the English-language website of Egypt’s leading newspaper, said that at least one person was killed in those confrontations. Violent faceoffs were also reported in Alexandria and other cities.

The pro-Morsi crowds, numbering in the tens of thousands, reflected the power of the Muslim Brotherhood to organize mass rallies in the aftermath of the military intervention that on Wednesday deposed Morsi, the Islamist who was Egypt’s first freely elected president. The Muslim Brotherhood called the protests the “Friday of Rejection” and insisted that Morsi be reinstated as the rightful head of state.

“We will bring him back bearing him on our necks, sacrifice our souls for him,” said Mohamed Badie, the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, who appeared at a mass pro-Morsi rally at the Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque, stirring the crowd into impassioned anger. “We will bring back the rights of the Egyptian people who were wronged by this disgraceful conspiracy.”
</P>
<P>
Badie said the widespread news media reports that he was among the Islamist leaders arrested in a post-Morsi crackdown by security forces were false. But in the aftermath of Morsi’s ouster, hundreds of Islamists were detained, and even though a few senior Muslim Brotherhood aides were released Friday, all indications pointed to a worsening divide between Morsi’s Islamist supporters and his critics - including the powerful military that deposed him.
</P>
<P>
Egypt’s military commanders have justified the ouster of Morsi by saying they felt compelled to bring the country back together after millions of Egyptians demonstrated against him, claiming he had sought to monopolize power, neglected the economy and worsened divisions in society.
