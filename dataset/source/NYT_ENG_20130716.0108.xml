CAIRO - In the clearest statement yet of the U.S. position on the Egyptian military’s ouster of President Mohammed Morsi, a senior American diplomat warned on Monday that the generals would jeopardize Egypt’s “second chance” at a democratic transition if their new interim government continued to crack down on Morsi’s Islamist supporters.

“If representatives of some of the largest parties in Egypt are detained or excluded, how are dialogue and participation possible?” Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns told journalists after meeting with generals and the interim officials they have appointed.

<P>
“It is hard to picture how Egypt will be able to emerge from this crisis unless its people come together to find a nonviolent and inclusive path forward,” Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Burns, the first senior U.S. official to visit Cairo since the takeover, spoke against the backdrop of a standoff between the military’s interim government and tens of thousands of Islamists who have staged a two-week sit-in to protest the ouster of Morsi, Egypt’s first freely elected president.

New clashes broke out between the Islamists and the police within hours of Burns’s statement.

Leaving their main encampment, thousands of Morsi’s supporters filled a major square, blocking a main bridge that is a central artery for the city’s traffic. They lit tires on fire to block streets and hurled rocks at police officers who tried to displace them. Riot police showered the Morsi supporters with bursts of tear gas, while opponents of the Islamists entered the fray and dragged some to a police station. By 1 a.m., the police had begun firing birdshot as well, state news media said.

Crowds of Morsi supporters also gathered across the Nile River at Cairo University and in other cities around the country. At least 22 people were injured in the Cairo clashes, according to the city’s ambulance authority.

<P>
Earlier Monday, Islamist militants in the Sinai Peninsula used rocket-propelled grenades to attack a bus, killing three people and injuring 17, state news media reported, part of an uptick in such attacks since Morsi’s ouster.
</P>
<P>
Seemingly all sides rebuffed Burns. The young organizers of the petition drive that preceded Morsi’s ouster, the ultraconservative Islamist party Al-Nour and officials of the Muslim Brotherhood all said they would not meet with Burns. And state news media reported anonymous military officials saying that Burns was more determined than his Egyptian counterparts to ensure the continued flow of American military aid.
