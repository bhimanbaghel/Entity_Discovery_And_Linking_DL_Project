SYRIAN FORCES RECAPTURE SUBURB FROM THE REBELS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIRUT - Syrian government forces recaptured a suburb south of Damascus on Wednesday and continued battles to push insurgents out of long-held territory outside the northern city of Aleppo, in what appeared to be a major push to gain ground ahead of proposed internationally sponsored peace talks.
</P>
<P>
State news media showed government troops entering Hujeira, the latest in a string of suburbs south of Damascus where the government has made inroads in recent days, trying to sever supply lines between rebel-held towns that form an arc around the capital.
</P>
<P>
Despite rebel claims to be tightening a noose around the seat of power, and government claims that the army would soon push rebels out of the suburbs, the front lines around the capital have changed little over the past year, with rebel and government forces dug in within a few hundred yards of each other in many places.
</P>
<P>
The standoff has been deadly for civilians. People have died of malnutrition in rebel enclaves blockaded by the government, which also suffer daily bombardments. In Damascus, rebel mortar rounds continue to land at random; on Wednesday, funerals were held for four schoolchildren killed when a shell hit their school bus near the capital’s old city.
</P>
<P>
Rebels pushed back by detonating an explosion in the southern Damascus neighborhood at Tadamon, long divided between government and rebel control. The explosion targeted a checkpoint that opposition activists said was staffed by Shiite militias aiding the government forces in the fight.
</P>
<P>
Around Aleppo, rebel groups have issued an emergency call for full mobilization of all insurgents after the government re-established control in recent days over key rebel strongholds. The city, Syria’s largest, has been divided between rebel and government control for months.
</P>
<P>
The intensifying fighting came as the main exile opposition group condemned the main Kurdish militia in the country’s northeast for declaring that it was establishing a self-ruled area there, analogous to neighboring Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
Many Syrians on both sides of the conflict see the Kurdish move as the latest sign of the de facto partitioning of a country increasingly ruled by a patchwork of warring groups.
</P>
<P>
Kurds, who make up 10 percent of Syria’s population, also dominate areas of neighboring Turkey and Iraq as well as Iran. All those countries fear Kurdish separatism and are players in Syria’s proxy war, making the fate of Syria’s Kurds an explosive issue.
</P>
<P>
The main Kurdish militia, run by the Democratic Union Party, known by its Kurdish-language abbreviation, PYD, declared Tuesday that it was setting up provisional self-rule centered on the provincial capital of Qamishli, near the Turkish border.
</P>
<P>
For months, fighting in the area has been less a contest between the government and rebels than a struggle for power and territory between Kurdish fighters and insurgent groups dominated by Sunni Arab Islamists, who have clashed in deadly battles.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition, dominated by Syria’s Sunni Arab majority, has sought to bring Kurds on board, and some Kurdish dissidents have joined the body. But rebel groups have grown frustrated that Kurdish militias and Islamist extremist groups alike have focused more on trying to control territory than on battling the government.
</P>
<P>
“The PYD is a group hostile to the Syrian revolution,” the main exile opposition group, the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The coalition has named its own interim government, saying that it will administer rebel-controlled areas, but has not proven able so far to assert control or provide services in many areas where local opposition groups and foreign-dominated Islamist groups are vying for military and administrative control.
