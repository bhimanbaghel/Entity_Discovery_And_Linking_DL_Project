Continuing violence affects UN aid in Syria: spokesperson

UNITED NATIONS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Unabated violence in many parts of Syria has limited access of the United Nations' humanitarian aid, though UN agencies have continued their assistance efforts, said a spokesperson for UN Secretary-general Ban Ki-moon here on Friday.

Fighting in the eastern provinces as well as in rural Damascus and Dera'a is limiting access for humanitarian aid. A number of areas with immense need of humanitarian aid remained inaccessible, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

"The Office also says that overall insecurity and a proliferation of checkpoints are slowing down movement of humanitarian goods, and bureaucratic processes continue to delay aid delivery and impede the efficiency of the emergency response," said Martin Nesirky.

Nesirky confirmed that the UN agencies are continuing their assistance. "The World Food Program is planning to increase its distributions to reach 3 million people, up from 2.5 million," he noted.

The UN Relief and Works Agency has reached over 58,000 people with food assistance and 59,000 people with cash assistance in the past two weeks. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization supported the Syrian Ministry of Health in Damascus with essential and communicable disease medicines to treat more than 90,000 people, said the spokesperson.

The Syrian civil war, which began in March 2011 between government forces and armed opposition seeking to oust President Bashar al-Assad, has killed more than 93,000 people and forced over 1.7 million people to flee the country.

According to the UN, at least 6.8 million Syrian people require urgent humanitarian aid, half of them children.  EnditemC
