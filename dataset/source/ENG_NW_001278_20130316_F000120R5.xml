Syrian opposition announces candidates for interim gov't president

ISTANBUL, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Syrian opposition umbrella group Syrian National Coalition (SNC) announced here Friday a list of more than 10 candidates for the president of an interim government it plans to form.

The opposition group said they are going elect the president in Istanbul on March 18 and 19.

Khaled Salih, director of the media office and member of the executive board in the SNC, revealed four major candidates at a press conference. They are Ghassan Hitto, the current vice president of the Assistance Coordination Unit (ACU), Salim Al Muslit, a member of SNC, Oussama Kadi and Wael Zouabi, both members of the SNC.

Speaking at the conference, Samir Nashar, a member of the SNC, said the major function of the interim government is to manage the "liberated area" of Syria, to provide the Syrians life necessities such as electricity, water and communication, to ensure safety in the "liberated area" and to provide governmental services.

"This government's headquarters should be inside Syria. If there is any security problem, the headquarter should be along the border. The government should be close to Syria to deliver support to Syrian people efficiently," Nashar added.

He said the president of the interim government should have the willingness and ability to work inside Syria. Furthermore, the interim government's goal is to get international acknowledgement and support of the "Syrian revolution."

Salah Al Din Al-Hamwi, a member of the SNC and representative of Hama's Local Council, emphasized that many foreign countries were trying to control the money and arms transferred to the " revolutionary forces." One of the major goal of the interim government is to utilize the local ministration and get financial support from inside Syria, Al-Hamwi said.

"We should use our own money so no one could control us," Al- Hamwi said, "All of the oil fields are in the control of the revolutionary force now. Also the agricultural areaPRA of Syria are completely freed from Assad's control. If we could manage to sell the oil and agricultural products such as wheat and cotton, it could generate huge profits to support the revolution. The oil products alone could generate at least 3 million U.S. dollars per day."

The SNC also issued a statement Friday on the occasion of the second anniversary of the "Syrian revolution," saying that " Syrians survived two years of tremendous challenges, but have also achieved significant steps in political, civil, military and relief areas. Nonetheless, the large challenges still before us only increase our determination to overthrow the Assad regime and establish the new Syria."  Enditem
