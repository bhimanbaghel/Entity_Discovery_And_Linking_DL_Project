MOSCOW - Edward J. Snowden, the fugitive former National Security Agency contractor wanted by the United States for leaking classified documents about global U.S. surveillance, fled his Hong Kong hide-out for Moscow on Sunday aboard a Russian jetliner, in what appeared to be the first step in an odyssey to seek political asylum in another country, possibly Ecuador or Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
In a day of frustration and dramatic scrambling by U.S. officials who are seeking Snowden’s extradition, he boarded an Aeroflot jetliner in Hong Kong that reached Moscow on Sunday afternoon. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Snowden was in a Moscow airport transit area, apparently awaiting a connection to another country.

Ecuador’s foreign minister said that Snowden had submitted a request for asylum, an assertion corroborated by WikiLeaks, the organization that discloses government secrets and has come to the assistance of Snowden. In a statement on its website, WikiLeaks said “he is bound or the Republic of Ecuador via a safe route for the purposes of asylum, and is being escorted by diplomats and legal advisors from WikiLeaks.”

The United States had asked Hong Kong authorities to find and detain Snowden, where he has been in hiding for the past few weeks, but the Hong Kong government said Sunday that it had requested clarifications about the request and legally could not stop him from boarding the flight to Moscow. A statement by the Hong Kong government - the first official word that Snowden had fled the territory - said it had informed the United States of his departure.

<P>
Russia’s Interfax news service, citing a “person familiar with the situation,” reported that Snowden would remain in transit at an airport in Moscow for “several hours” pending an onward flight to Cuba on Monday, and would therefore not formally cross the Russian border or be subject to detention.

Ricardo Patiño Aroca, the foreign minister of Ecuador, said “The Government of Ecuador has received an asylum request from Edward J. Snowden” in a Twitter message. But Russia’s Interfax quoted an unidentified person close to Snowden as saying he planned to continue to Caracas, Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
WikiLeaks said in a statement on its Twitter feed that it had “assisted Mr. Snowden’s political asylum in a democratic country, travel papers” and safe exit from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Sunday, a Justice Department spokeswoman, Nanda Chitre, confirmed that the Hong Kong authorities had told Washington of Snowden’s departure and said that the government would pursue Snowden’s case.
