UN secretary-general calls for fresh donations worldwide to Philippine typhoon-hit areas

MANILA, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said here Sunday that the United Nations stands firmly with the Philippines in its efforts to deal with the aftermath of typhoon Haiyan and the reconstruction endeavours.

Ban Ki-moon said at a press briefing in Metro Manila on Sunday that the United Nations and partners had launched a one-year Strategic Response Plan for 791 million U.S. dollars.

He called on all donor countries to add to their already generous support to the Philippines when he met with key ambassadors stationed in the Philippines on Sunday morning.

"I have come to the Philippines to show solidarity with the government and people of the Philippines so hard hit by Typhoon Yolanda," he said.

After a visit to Tacloban, one of the worst-hit cities in central Philippines, he said, "I was deeply moved and also inspired by my visit to Tacloban. People are working hard to recover."

There has been excellent cooperation between the United Nations and its partners and the Philippine authorities at every level, he said.

Aid deliveries have been scaled up significantly. More than 4 million affected people have now received food assistance. More than 200,000 households have received emergency shelter, he added.

Ban Ki-moon arrived in Philippine capital region on Friday for a three-day visit. He met with Philippine President Benigno Aquino III and visited Tabloban city on Saturday.

The Philippines is among the most vulnerable nations to natural disasters. Super typhoon Haiyan, or locally known as Yolanda, hit the country's central part on Nov. 8, killing 6,109 people and injuring 27,665 others. Up to Sunday, 1,779 are still missing.  Enditem
