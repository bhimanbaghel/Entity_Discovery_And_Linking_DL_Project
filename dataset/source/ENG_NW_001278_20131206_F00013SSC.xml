Nelson Mandela shining beacon to freedom-loving peoples: Philippines

MANILA, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines mourned on Friday the death of former South African President Nelson Mandela, describing him as a "shining beacon of inspiration to all freedom- loving peoples".

Philippine Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Secretary Herminio Coloma, Jr. said at a press briefing on Friday, "We grieve over the death of Nelson Mandela, a revered world leader, who led his nation and people to freedom by treading the path of peace."

"He endured decades of imprisonment with unwavering fortitude and perseverance, affirming that taking the peaceful, non-violent path to freedom is one that brings about sustained and enduring fulfillment of a people's aspirations for full emancipation," he said.

He added, "In death as in life, he will always be a shining beacon of inspiration to all freedom-loving peoples."

Meanwhile, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a statement that the Philippines will forever be honored to have hosted Mandela's visit to the country in 1996.

DFA said, the late President Mandela's extraordinary integrity, his tireless commitment and his grand vision that embraced equality for all even under the most trying of circumstances shall never be forgotten.   Enditem
