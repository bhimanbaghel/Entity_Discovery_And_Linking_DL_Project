Roundup: Muslim Brotherhood vows daily protests in Egypt

CAIRO, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- Muslim Brotherhood (MB) group, from which ousted president Mohamed Morsi hails, on Friday called for daily demonstrations after "the Friday of anger" as they dubbed killed at least 48.

Gehad El-Haddad, the MB's spokesman, said supporters of Morsi will continue "peaceful" protests on daily basis across Egypt.

On his twitter page, Haddad wrote, "from today, the farewell week for toppling the coup has started, and all the peaceful proceedings will continue every day in all Egypt's governorates in the same gathering points."

On Friday evening, military armored vehicles headed to Ramses Square in downtown Cairo to contain the ongoing clashes.

Ramses Square has been in a mess throughout the day, as a large number of pro-Morsi protesters engaged in clashes with some of the residents as well as with security forces, which led to a lot of damage, including a building set ablaze.

On Wednesday, at least 578 were killed and over 4,200 were injured while security forces dispersed major pro-Morsi sit-ins in Cairo and Giza, besides relevant confrontations across the country.

Some 821 MB members were arrested; and 22 weapons, seven bombs and 710 bullets were seized in 18 governrates on Friday, official news agency MENA reported.

An evangelical church in Minya has reportedly been torched by Islamists militants, while others stormed the traffic administration building and set it ablaze.

"Seven were killed in Damietta, four in Ismailia, three in Giza, three in Cairo, one in Sohag," MENA quoted Mohamed Sultan, head of Egypt's Ambulance Authority, as saying.

Later, MENA added three were killed in Suez Canal governorate of Port Said and more than 60 people injured.

Also, state-run TV reported 16 people were killed in Alexandria and 140 injured. In the capital alone, at least 250 were injured.

The Interior Ministry put the death toll at 48, with 436 injured.

State-run Nile TV showed footage that in one of pro-Mors)t:	i marches after Friday's Noon Prayer in Cairo, some masked gunmen, among hundreds of protesters over the May 15th Bridge, opened fire mostly at residents of nearby buildings and the street under the bridge.

Violence in Egypt has stirred different reactions from international community, as EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton called Friday for the bloc to adopt "appropriate measures" in response.

Describing the violence in Egypt as "shocking," Ashton said that "I have asked member state representatives to debate and coordinate appropriate measures to be taken by the European Union in response to the situation in Egypt."

Germany said it would review ties with Cairo, and joined France in calling for EU talks on the situation, which are expected to take place on Monday.

The Egyptian Foreign Ministry decided Friday to cancel a joint naval maneuver with Turkey, dubbed "Sea of Friendship 2013," over the recent tension between the two countries, the Egyptian state TV reported. The joint training was supposed to be held in Turkey from Oct. 21 to Oct. 28.

The Foreign Ministry's statement said that the decision comes " in protest against the Turkish unacceptable statements and practices that represent explicit interference in the Egyptian domestic affairs," the state TV said.

On Thursday, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry recalled the ambassador to Turkey Abdel-Rahman Salah for consultations, after Ankara has also recalled its ambassador in Cairo.  On Friday, Egypt decided to recall its ambassador to Ecuador for consultations, Foreign Ministry spokesman Badr Abdel-Aati said.

Also, Egypt will be delaying the naming of the head of its diplomatic mission in Mauritius, he said. The move comes after both countries recalled their ambassadors to Egypt, he added.

Meanwhile, the Egyptian cabinet issued a statement on Friday, describing the Brotherhood organization as "terrorists and outlaws. "

In the statement, the cabinet expressed thanks and appreciation to Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud for his support to Egypt against terrorist forces.

King Al Saud said Friday that his kingdom supports Egypt in the fight against "terrorism," according to a speech aired by Saudi- funded al-Arabiya TV.

"The kingdom stands with the Egyptian people in the fight against terrorism," said the Saudi king.

The Saudi king said Egypt's stability is being targeted by " haters," warning that anyone interfering in Egypt's internal affairs is "igniting sedition," according to the TV channel.  Enditem
