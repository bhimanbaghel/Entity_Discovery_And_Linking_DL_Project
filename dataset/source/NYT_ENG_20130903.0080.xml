By buying Nokia’s handset business, Microsoft may have strengthened its control over the destiny of its mobile operations and gained a potential new chief executive.
</P>
<P>
But completing the $7.2 billion transaction, the technology giant’s second-biggest after the acquisition of Skype, was a lengthy process that was anything but straightforward, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, first approached Nokia about a deal during the Mobile World Congress industry conference in Barcelona this year. He emphasized to Stephen Elop, his counterpart at Nokia since 2010, that the software company needed to continue its hardware evolution by developing smaller handsets.

<P>
Integrating hardware and software, in the mold of Apple, was an important priority. But Microsoft also wanted to ensure that Elop, a former executive, would come along as part of the deal. Nokia at that point felt that Elop was compromised and arranged for Riisto Siilasmaa, the Finnish company’s chairman, to take over negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Still, the prospect of Nokia shedding its core business weighed heavily on the company. Nokia’s directors met around 50 times in person to discuss virtually every angle of the deal, from valuation to the potential impact on the handset unit’s 32,000 workers.

<P>
Much of the discussions were held directly between Ballmer and Siilasmaa, who met discreetly in Helsinki, London, New York and Seattle, among other cities. The talks moved deliberately, with both sides taking time to figure out how the new structure would work and figure out how to unravel the commercial agreements.
</P>
<P>
This summer, talks between the two sides cooled, as the complexities of the transaction took a toll. They resumed in July, with a broad agreement on the principles of the transaction reached by the end of that month.
