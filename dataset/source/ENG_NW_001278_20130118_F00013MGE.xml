Cyprus heads for presidential elections

NICOSIA, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Financially depressed Cyprus officially got on the way to presidential elections on Friday, with a bailout agreement provisionally agreed upon with international lenders still hanging in the air.

A total of 11 people officially submitted candidacy papers by the time a deadline expired at noon on Friday, by only three of them are considered to be serious presidential contenders. The rest are predicted by polls to collect a total of only a few hundred votes out of a total of less than half a million votes expected to be cast on Feb. 17.

Main right-wing opposition DISY (Democratic Rally) party leader Nicos Anastasiades is projected by opinion polls to be the next Cyprus leader, to succeed incumbent president Demetris Christofias.

An recent opinion poll by state broadcaster Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation showed Anastasiades could have the support of 38 percent of the voters, leading by a 14-percentage-point advantage over his nearest rival, former Health Minister Stavros Malas, who is supported by left wing AKEL (The Working People's Progressive) party.

George Lillikas, an ex-minister in a former government supported by a small socialist party, trails even further behind, with 19.7 percent.

The opinion poll suggested Anastasiades to be close to an outright electoral win on Feb. 17. Should there be a runoff election on Feb. 24, he is also projected to comfortably clinch victory from either of his two main opponents.

Christofias refrained from participating in this year's presidential election following five disastrous years in power.

His term in office was marred by the explosion of about 500 tons of confiscated Iranian explosives and munitions destined for Syria on July, 2011, which killed 13 people and destroyed Cyprus' latest and biggest power station, making even worse a creeping economic crisis.

Following the explosion Christofias said he would not seek re-election and was forced to request a bailout for Cyprus from its European partners and the International Monetary Fun, after the island's two main banks sought state financing due to huge losses on account of the writedown of the Greek debt, to which Christofias had consented.

A bailout memorandum agreed between Cyprus and international lenders is not expected to be finalized before the end of January, pending establishment of the actual amount for the recapitalization of the banking system.

This will burden the next president with the task of concluding the agreement. The delay will also leave the government on the brink of insolvency as money in the coffers can only meet immediate needs up to the end of February.

Outgoing Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said on Friday he would go to a Eurogroup ministerial meeting on Monday empty-handed, because a report on a due diligence report of the banks, originally expected to be released on Friday, would not materialize by then.

Shiarly said the Eurogroup was expected to touch upon the Cyprus bailout but would not reach any decisions.

He said that a delay in finalizing the bailout would leave the task to the next president.

"This is of no consequence, as the building blocks of the bailout package have been put in place", Shiarly said.

The recapitalization sum for the banks has been provisionally set at 10 billion euros. Cypriot authorities are striving to keep the sum to below 8 billion euros to avoid pushing the total sovereign debt upwards to an unmanageable level.  Enditem
