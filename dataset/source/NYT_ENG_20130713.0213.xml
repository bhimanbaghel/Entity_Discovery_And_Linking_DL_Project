BEIRUT - Competing rebel factions in Syria are increasingly attacking each other in a series of killings, kidnappings and beheadings, undermining the already struggling effort to topple President Bashar Assad.
</P>
<P>
The open hostilities could no longer be contained Friday, when a Western-aligned group, the Free Syrian Army, demanded that an al-Qaida-linked rebel faction, the Islamic State of Iraq and Al Sham, turn over the suspected killers of a prominent commander who was shot down Thursday. Commanders with the Free Syrian Army warned that the broader movement against Assad was being threatened by the conflict between itself and the Islamic State.

<P>
The infighting is a new low for an opposition that was never able to unite its military or civilian operations. Across the expanse of the battlefield in Syria, in places like the northeastern province of Raqqa and the divided city of Aleppo, rebels are attacking each other and their supporters with regularity and ferocity. Competition for recruits and weapons - and the right to define the character of the future state - has fueled the interrebel battles.

“The Islamic State wants to eliminate the Free Syrian Army higher command,” Ahmed Farzat, a Free Syrian Army lieutenant, said in an interview on Skype from the central city of Homs, where rebels are struggling against a fierce government assault. “In other words, to marginalize it and replace it.”

Kamal Hamami, the Free Syrian Army commander killed Thursday in the coastal province of Latakia, had just met with others in the group about getting weapons. The Islamic State was apparently angry that he was planning an operation without consulting them, said Anas, another activist who witnessed the attack and posted a video of it online. Hamami’s men were blocked by Islamic State fighters angry that a checkpoint had been set up without their permission.
</P>
<P>
The commanders of the two groups quarreled, Anas said, and the Islamic State commander, Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, shot Hamami dead.
</P>
<P>
The collection of groups fighting the government has always been an uneasy alliance, and some rebels have long said they expected to battle the more radical groups - after defeating Assad - over their desire to monopolize power and impose religious rule.
</P>
<P>
“The sea is in front of us and the enemy is behind us,” said Sheik Jassem al-Awad, a tribal leader in Raqqa, adding that he felt squeezed between the government and the radical Islamists. “The Free Syrian Army cannot open two fronts at once.”
