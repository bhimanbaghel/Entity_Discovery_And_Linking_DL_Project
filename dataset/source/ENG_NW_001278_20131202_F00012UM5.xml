China provides further assistance to Philippine typhoon-hit areas

MANILA, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- China on Monday provided a batch of payloaders which are badly needed in the clean-up of roads in typhoon-devastated areas in central Philippines as the country embarks on the road of reconstruction.

Three payloader trucks were handed over to the Philippine Red Cross Society (PRCS) at a ceremony at PRCS headquarters in Manila. They were donated by the Association of Chinese Enterprises (ACE) in the Philippines.

Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Ma Keqing said that this was additional assistance to central Philippine regions ravaged by typhoon Haiyan, or locally known as Yolanda, after the initial donation of 100,000 U.S. dollars, respectively, from the Chinese government and the Chinese Red Cross Society.

She said China's assistance to the Philippines is provided step by step. The 73 million Pesos (1.67 million U.S. dollars) worth of relief goods delivered to the Philippine side on Nov. 19. Later, a cargo of 37.8 million pesos worth of supplies arrived in Cebu on Nov. 21.

Apart from relief funds and materials, China has also dispatched three medical teams, including the country's largest hospital ship Peace Ark, to hardest-hit areas in Eastern Visayas including Tacloban city. Chinese doctors have received more than 3, 500 patients in the first seven days of operation. Two babies have so far been born on the hospital ship.

The Chinese people closely follow the rescue and reconstruction process at typhoon-hit areas and show their readiness in helping the Philippine people, she added.

In reply, PRCS Chairman Richard Gordon said "We thank the Chinese people for their generosity in giving much needed support to the Philippine Red Cross."

He revealed that the three payloaders will be used in road clean-up in worst-hit Tacloban city, and later be used in other natural calamities.

ACE Chairman Wang Yong said Philippine-based Chinese enterprises have exerted their efforts in helping typhoon victims starting from the day of typhoon's onslaught. The payloaders, valued at nearly 8 million pesos, were donated by the 40-plus members of the Chinese enterprises association.

Typhoon Haiyan has claimed 5,670 lives and injured 26,233 others, with 1,761 still missing. The affected population totaled 11 million, among which 4 million have been displaced. The Philippines has shifted its emphasis from rescue to reconstruction. Enditem
