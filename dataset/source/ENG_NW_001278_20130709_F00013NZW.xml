2nd LD: Egypt's caretaker president appoints interim PM, vice president

CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's interim President Adli Mansour appointed Tuesday ex-finance minister Hazem al-Beblawi as prime minister and leading figure of the National Salvation Front (NSF) Mohamed ElBaradei as vice president for foreign affairs in the transitional government.

Al-Beblawi served as the finance minister in the cabinet of former prime minister Essam Sharaf, who resigned in late November 2011.

ElBaradei, the leader of the NSF, which is in opposition to ousted president Mohamed Morsi's administration, was the former head of the International Agency for Atomic Energy.

On Wednesday, embattled Morsi was ousted by the army after millions of people took to the streets to protest against his " poor performance" and "maladministration" since he took office a year ago.

The armed forces then handed over power to Adli Mansour, the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court, to run the country for a transitional period.

On late Saturday evening, Egypt's newly-appointed presidential media adviser denied the appointment of ElBaradei as the country's interim prime minister. Salafist al-Nour Party objected the appointment of ElBaradei due to his affiliation.

Meantime, the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, to which Morsi belongs, also rejected ElBaradei's nomination.  Enditem
