KIEV, Ukraine - Ukraine’s embattled president, Viktor Yanukovych, who is facing the dual problems of a financial crisis and protesters in a central square here in the capital, convened Tuesday what his government is calling a round-table discussion of cultural figures and former politicians.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Yanukovych strengthened his negotiating position by boosting the police presence in Kiev. While the main demonstration continued in the plaza, Independence Square, on Tuesday, the police dislodged protesters from several smaller outlying camps they had erected in a district of government buildings, largely without violence.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych was expected to meet with three former Ukrainian presidents, Leonid M. Kravchuk, Leonid D. Kuchma and Viktor A. Yushchenko. The format of the meeting and its name, the round table, appeared borrowed from the negotiations that defused the street protest movement here in 2004, known as the Orange Revolution.

<P>
Senior envoys including the European foreign affairs chief, Catherine Ashton, and a U.S. assistant secretary of state, Victoria Nuland, arrived in Kiev to convey the message from Western governments that the protests should not be dispersed violently.
</P>
<P>
The renewed diplomatic maneuvering was intended to prevent a repeat of the bloodshed during a crackdown by the police in Kiev on Nov. 30, and to contain the widening civil uprising, which has plunged the nation into deep uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
The State Department issued a statement Monday saying that Nuland, in talks in Moscow, had conveyed the U.S. position that “the U.S. supports Ukraine’s European choice, a nonviolent and just political resolution to the current standoff, and a return to economic health with the support of the International Monetary Fund.”
</P>
<P>
Yet the Western envoys’ leverage appeared to be waning as new details emerged of the Ukrainian government’s successes in securing bailout financing from China and Russia in place of aid from the IMF, which would likely be contingent on a peaceful resolution of the domestic political impasse.
</P>
<P>
On a presidential visit to China that coincided with the beginning of the protests, Yanukovych negotiated an agreement for Chinese companies to invest $7 billion in the development of a port on the Crimean Peninsula, on the Black Sea, the Russian news site Gazeta.ru reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government’s website had earlier claimed progress in securing billions of dollars in Chinese investment in a chemical plant and on a long-negotiated deal to lease Ukrainian farmland to Chinese agribusiness companies.
