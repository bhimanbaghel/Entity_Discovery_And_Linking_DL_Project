Roundup: Cyprus bailout deal sends shock and flock to banks

NICOSIA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of depositors rushed to cooperative banks early in the morning on Saturday to withdraw their deposits following an Eurozone bailout deal for Cyprus - only to be told that their deposits had been temporarily blocked.

The Eurogroup Brussels deal, concluded in the early hours of Saturday after a marathon negotiation which lasted over 10 hours, sent waves of shock through the entire population as it includes a haircut on all bank deposits - a measure which authorities said had not been part of the bailout negotiations.

Cooperative banks are the only monetary institutions offering bank services on Saturday, while commercial banks are closed.

Automatic cash machines at banks were also blocked.

Eurogroup and International Monetary Fund officials working through the night in Brussels forced on newly elected Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades, taking part in a European meeting for the first time, a so-called "solidarity levy" of 9.9 percent by bank depositors whose savings exceeded 100,000 euros and 6.75 percent on those having smaller deposits.

Some European countries, most notably Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, had been insisting all along the drawn out negotiations that Russian "oligarchs" with fat deposits in Cypriot banks be forced to take a loss, but the measure was finally extended to include all depositors.

Owners of bank accounts will be compensated by bank stock issue.

The one-off levy on bank deposits, along with a tax on the interest of deposits, has been designed as part of other measures to force a downsizing of the banking system of Cyprus, now eight times the size of its annual economy, to 3.5 times, which is the EU average.

The levy is expected to generate just under 6 billion euros, resulting in a lower bailout amount which is estimated to be around 10 billion euros. The money will be given by euro countries, along with the International Monetary Fund, which will reportedly contribute one billion euros.

Participation of the IMF in the Cyprus bailout was a precondition set down by some euro group countries.

The deal struck in Brussels requires that the levy be imposed by March 19, meaning that the Cypriot parliament will have to meet in an emergency session either on Sunday or on Monday, which is a public holiday, to pass necessary legislations.

The bailout deal also included an increase of 2.5 percentage points on the corporate tax to 12.5 percent, expected to generate 200 million euros a year, and also salary and pension cuts, along with tax hikes already in force since last summer.

The bailout program is expected to allow Cyprus to reduce its sovereign debt down to 100 percent of its GDP by 2020.

Without a bailout deal Cyprus would soon slip into an uncontrolled default and this fact was used as leverage on the eastern Mediterranean island's government by hard bargaining EU partners and the International Monetary Fund.

The state broadcaster reported from Brussels that during the 10-hour hard bargaining the Cypriot president had threatened three times to leave the negotiations and asked for a break to consult with political associates.

In the end he was faced with the dilemma of either a default along with exiting the eurozone or accepting the tough measures dictated by Germany and other tough-playing partners.

Cyprus finance minister said it had been a difficult decision to take, which however averts a bankruptcy and offers the possibility of a new start in building up the economy.

However, he seemed to be himself shocked by the Eurogroup decision, which triggered widespread reaction in Cyprus.

"I wish I was not the minister to do this," Sarris said after the negotiations were over.

Sarris will travel to Moscow on Wednesday to conclude a deal with his Russian counterpart on extending the maturing of a 2.5 billion euro Russian loan to Cyprus from 2016 to 2021 and on reducing the loan interest from 4.5 to 2.5 per cent.

Cyprus had asked for a further 2 billion euro loan from Russia but European Commissioner for economic and monetary affairs Ohli Rehn said Moscow did not seem willing to contribute further to a Cyprus rescue.

Despite the conclusion of the rescue deal, many details have yet to be finalized, including selling Cypriot bank interests in Greece for an estimated 2 billion euros.

The two largest Cypriot banks are estimated to have given loans totaling 25 billion euros to Greek businesses and households.

The two banks will require about 10 billion euros to recapitalize following their losses in Greece, which also resulted out of holding Greek bonds worth 6 billion euros, which were reduced in value by almost 75 percent as part of the country's bailout. Enditem
