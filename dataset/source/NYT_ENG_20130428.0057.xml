TEARS AND RAGE AS HOPE FADES IN BANGLADESH

SAVAR, Bangladesh – For five days after a garment factory building collapsed, rescue teams had retrieved corpses and survivors.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people surrounded the site Sunday, watching the huge rescue operation, even as hopes faded that many more victims would be found alive.
</P>
<P>
With national outrage boiling over, Bangladeshi paramilitary officers tracked down and arrested Sohel Rana, the building’s owner, who was hiding near the Indian border, and returned him to Dhaka. When loudspeakers at the rescue site announced his capture, local news reports said, the crowd broke out in cheers.

The collapse of Rana Plaza is considered the deadliest accident in the history of the garment industry. It is known to have claimed at least 377 lives, and hundreds more workers are thought to be missing, buried in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
Rana Plaza contained five garment factories, employing more than 3,000 workers, who were making clothing for European and U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
For days, rescuers crawled through pancaked spaces on their hands and knees, afraid that using heavy machinery would collapse the building further. Lowered precariously into holes, they called out through the rubble and the darkness, listening for the voices of survivors. Many were saved in the painstaking process.

“We were shouting, asking if anyone was alive,” said Sharif ul-Islam, 35, a firefighter. “We would say, ‘If anyone is alive, please make a sound! We will come to you!”’
</P>
<P>
With so many lives ruined or lost, public anger has largely focused on Rana, the building’s owner. Garment industry leaders have blamed him for lying about the structural safety of the building; when cracks were discovered the day before the disaster, Rana is accused of assuring factory bosses that the building was safe to operate.
</P>
<P>
After his arrest, Rana blamed the owners of the garment factories for insisting on operating the morning of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
“I did not force the owners,” he said, according to bdnews24.com, an online news source in Bangladesh. “It was them who forced me, saying they would face huge losses, and shipments would be canceled if the factories were closed for even one day.”
</P>
<P>
There are still thousands of people clinging to hope. A woman sat less than 50 yards from the building, crying.
</P>
<P>
When a soldier asked her to move somewhere safer and farther away, she wailed. She had two sons somewhere inside the building.
</P>
<P>
“It would be better if you killed me,” she said, “than if you asked me to go away.”
