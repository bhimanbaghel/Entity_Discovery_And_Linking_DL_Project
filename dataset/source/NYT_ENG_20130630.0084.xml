WASHINGTON - Julian Assange, the founder of the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks, said Sunday that even as Edward J. Snowden remained in diplomatic limbo at a Moscow airport, the disclosures from the classified documents he took as a National Security Agency contractor would continue.
</P>
<P>
“Look, there is no stopping the publishing process at this stage,” Assange said on the ABC News program “This Week.” “Great care has been taken to make sure that Snowden can’t be pressured by any state to stop the publication process.”
</P>
<P>
The fallout from Snowden’s revelations widened this weekend as the German magazine Der Spiegel reported that the United States had eavesdropped on European Union offices in Washington, Brussels and at the United Nations in New York.

<P>
Assange, speaking from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London where he has been ensconced for more the a year after being granted asylum, praised Snowden’s actions and compared his plight with his own. He said Snowden was likely to be indicted by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., that Assange said was “made up of the CIA, Pentagon.”
</P>
<P>
“He is a hero,” Assange said of Snowden. “He has told the people of the world and the United States that there is mass unlawful interception of their communications, far beyond anything that happened under Nixon.”
</P>
<P>
WikiLeaks played no role in Snowden’s disclosures, but since joining forces with him, the organization has used his case to raise its own profile again.
</P>
<P>
In sometimes testy exchanges with George Stephanopoulos, the host of “This Week,” Assange found himself on the defensive in trying to explain Ecuador’s human rights record and to counter accusations that WikiLeaks was manipulating Snowden.
</P>
<P>
Snowden’s father told NBC News this week that in a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., he said his son might agree to return to the United States to stand trial on espionage charges if certain conditions were met.
</P>
<P>
The father, Lonnie Snowden, who said he had not spoken with his son since April, said that he was “concerned about those who surround him,” specifically advisers from WikiLeaks. “I think WikiLeaks, if you’ve looked at past history, their focus isn’t necessarily the Constitution of the United States,” Lonnie Snowden said. “It’s simply to release as much information as possible.”
</P>
<P>
Assange said Sunday that he sympathized with the elder Snowden and said that WikiLeaks had contacted Lonnie Snowden’s lawyer “to put some of his concerns to rest.”
