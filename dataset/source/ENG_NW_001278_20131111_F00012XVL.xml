Roundup: Indonesia provides relief aid for typhoon victims in Philippines

by Abu Hanifah

JAKARTA, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has worked out initiative steps in delivering relief aids for the Philippines people affected by super typhoon "Haiyan" that has been ransacking the neighboring country since Friday.

Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has officially ordered the country's disaster mitigation agency BNPB and the authorities to coordinate with the Philippines  to deliver the aids.

President Yudhoyono's Spokesperson Julian Aldrin Pasha said on Sunday that the president had instructed BNPB to take all measures necessary in doing so in the capacity of the Philippines' friendly country and a member of the ASEAN Community.

"The Indonesian government realized that it's now the most difficult time for the people and the Philippines government and we would continue monitoring the needs of the Philippines ( regarding the disaster)," Julian said.

BNPB Spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said that the Indonesian ambassador to the Philippines had informed the government about what the affected areas need most, including drinking water, power generators, medical supplies particularly antibiotics and instant food.

The number of deaths caused by super typhoon "Haiyan" (local name Yolanda) rose to 1774 by Monday night, a Philippine government agency said.

Of the total fatalities, 1660 were found in worst-hit eastern Visayas region, said National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) spokesman Rey Balido said.

He said 82 were still missing and 2,487 were injured.

Balido said they expected the number of casualties to increase as they were awaiting reports from other areas.  Sutopo said that BNPB, the foreign affairs ministry, the health ministry, the national search and rescue team (Basarnas), police and the military have conducted coordination efforts with ASEAN's humanitarian assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) regarding the logistic and supplies transportation to the affected areas of the Philippines.

Indonesia has planned to use the military's cargo plane C-130 Hercules to transport all of those supplies, Sutopo said.

Philippine President Benigno Aquino III on Monday night declared state of national calamity as death toll grew after the most powerful typhoon hit the country last Friday.

Aquino said in a televised message that through the declaration of state of national calamity, assistance to the affected communities would be fast-tracked.

"The declaration of a state of national calamity will hasten the rescue, recovery, relief and rehabilitation efforts of the government and the private sector, including international humanitarian assistance," according to Proclamation No. 682.

The president said that the declaration will, among others, effectively control the prices of basic goods and commodities for the affected areas.  Enditem
