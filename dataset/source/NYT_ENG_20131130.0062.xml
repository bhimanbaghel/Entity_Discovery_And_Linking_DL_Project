KIEV, Ukraine - After the police violently dispersed several hundred protesters in the center of this roiled capital early Saturday, thousands more took to the streets to denounce President Viktor F. Yanukovich’s refusal to sign far-reaching political and free-trade accords with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Waving blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags and the flag of Europe, demonstrators swirled in a huge mass on the cobblestone streets outside the centuries-old St. Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery.
</P>
<P>
Furious over the failed agreements and enraged by what they said was excessive brutality of the police, protesters shouted, “Kiev rise up!” and “Glory to Ukraine! Glory to her heroes!”
</P>
<P>
Riot police officers, swinging truncheons and spraying bursts of tear gas, forcibly broke up the crowd in Independence Square, which had been the main protest site for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of about 10,000 people had gathered there Friday night as the EU summit meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania, where Yanukovich had originally planned to sign the agreements, was drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred protesters chanting for Yanukovich’s resignation were still gathered there when the police, wearing helmets and carrying body shields, moved in about 4:30 a.m., according to local news accounts and videos posted online by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
At least three dozen people were beaten, said Roman Sharan, 21, a veterinary student who was in the crowd and had a deep red welt on his knee from having been hit with a truncheon. Sharan said the violence had been unprovoked, with the police not warning protesters to leave, but viciously beating them. He said he had been knocked to the ground and kicked in the head before being thrown into a detention vehicle with others.

Some of the demonstrators ran from the police and took refuge inside the ornate monastery, with its eggshell blue facade and bell-and-clock tower topped by the golden dome for which it is named. A group remained inside the monastery through Saturday evening as a large crowd formed outside.
</P>
<P>
The violent dispersal immediately inflamed an already volatile situation in which protesters have been gathering daily in Kiev and in cities across the country to denounce Yanukovich for backing away from the accords with Europe. It also threatened to widen Ukraine’s political rift with the West, which was on open display at the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Kiev metropolitan police said that at least 35 people had been arrested, on various charges of hooliganism and resisting law enforcement authorities, and were released with administrative summonses.
</P>
<P>
A police statement said that the enforcement action had begun after protesters “threw garbage, cups, water bottles and set sticks on fire,” and that officers had been asked to clear the square because protesters were in the way of workers trying to install holiday decorations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Kiev issued a statement Saturday censuring the use of force and urging the Ukrainian government to respect the rights of demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
“The United States condemns the violence against protesters on Independence Square early this morning,” the embassy said. “We urge the government of Ukraine to respect the rights of civil society and the principles of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.”
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, issued a similar statement.
</P>
<P>
“Violence and intimidation should have no place in today’s Ukraine,” she said.
</P>
<P>
Senior EU officials also issued a forceful statement, condemning the violence.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has canceled plans to attend a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is to be held here this week, but other Western officials are already arriving, and the criticism was certain to intensify.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovich has said that he was under pressure to delay the accords by Russia, Ukraine’s eastern neighbor and most important economic partner. He has called for new negotiations with the Kremlin and the EU - a proposal that the Europeans have so far rejected.
