# Entity_Discovery_And_Linking_DL_Project

Introduction
---
Entity resolution, the task of automatically determining which mentions refer to the same
real-world entity, is a crucial aspect of knowledge base construction and management.
However, performing this task for a large data could be very challenging and could lead to
problems of rule-based mention extraction system. The system models has to handle the
mention extraction through predefined rules. We used a deep learning model for entity
identification problem in order to recognize all the entities present in a text. Moreover
another model is been used to classify the entities and generate the features correspondingly.
These features are combined to form the vector representation of the mentions in order to
solve coreference resolution problem. We would use concepts of deep learning and Natural
Language Processing to build a model mostly using recurrent neural network and LSTM to
provide a better working and scalable solution to entity linking.
